  This lightweight application is to track the user's workout routine. Using Moment.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose schemas, the app tracks the names of different workouts, the exercises that make up the workout and the last time the user did that workout. The user can add new workouts and add exercise details to each one. Also, if the user is interested, the app calculates the total weight lifted within each workout.
